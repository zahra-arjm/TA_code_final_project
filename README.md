# TA_code_final_project
Analysis of a Gamified contest. It is the final project for an advanced data analysis course by Kaaryar college.
It was a 3-day contest at a job fair with rewards at the end of each day. The items included a dozen questionnaires designed to familiarize contestants with one specific company in Iran.
The data consisted of 20 datasets, some for keeping track of missions (questionnaires) and their points, and others for keeping score of user profiles and activity. Since the data is not publicly available, I do not have permission to share it here.
